        <p class="text-secondary mb-4">
          The Music Genre Classifier is an academic project focused on applying
          audio signal processing and deep learning techniques to automatically
          classify music into distinct genres.

              <p class="text-secondary mb-0">
                We built this project to better understand how audio features such as
                Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) can represent musical
                characteristics, and how convolutional neural networks can learn
                time–frequency patterns for genre classification.

              <h2 class="h6 mb-2">Technical Focus</h2>
              <p class="text-secondary mb-0">
                The system extracts MFCC features from audio tracks, divides each track
                into multiple time segments, and feeds these representations into a CNN
                trained on the GTZAN dataset. Segment-level predictions are averaged to
                produce a robust final genre prediction. This approach bridges concepts
                from signal processing, pattern recognition, and deep learning.
